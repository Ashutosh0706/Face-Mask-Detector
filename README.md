# Face-Mask-Detector
Due to this COVID-19 pandemic, masks are mandatory almost everywhere. So, I had created a Face Mask Detector App which will identify a person whether he/she has wore a mask or not. I had trained the model with some sample images. The training images are different and the testing are different. The code of the project is available in **Face-Mask-Detector.ipynb**. Plesae add **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml** file to the directory. You can find the training and testing sample images at https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/
There are a lot of training and testing images used in this project, that's why I haven't put the file here. You can get it from the link above.
